# UFOs

## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of this analysis is to enable the end user to be able to filter a UFO sightings database across multiple search criteria (date, city, state, country, shape).  From a skills standpoint, we needed to take the website built in the module work and refactor the code to accomplish the following:
* html code: add additional search boxes
* html code: remove the search button
* html code: tell d3 to listen for change rather than a handleclick
* javascript code: create a new object to hold the filter criteria
* javascript code: write new code to filter the table and build a new table with only the rows matching the filter criteria

## Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

## Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
